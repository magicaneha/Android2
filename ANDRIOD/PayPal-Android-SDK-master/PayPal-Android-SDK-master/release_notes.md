-----
* Minor bug fixes.

2.0.1
-----
* Fix values for product_name and build_time returned by SDK.

2.0.0
-----
* Add Future Payment with PayPal support. Users can now authenticate and consent within an app using the SDK.  A user no longer needs to repeatedly enter credentials.

* Changes to payment feature:
	* Change backend to use PayPal's new REST APIs for all SDK functions.  Now there is a single way to verify both credit card and PayPal payments.
	* Introduce `PayPalPaymentDetails` to support payment details, including line-item subtotal amount, tax amount, and shipping amount.
	* Single payments now include a payment`intent` to distinguish between:
		1. immediate payment processing
		2. payment authorization only, with subsequent payment capture from the merchant's server.
* Use `PayPalConfiguration` object for common configuration across both single payment and future payment use cases.
* For API errors, logging will now provide additional information, including a PayPal Debug-ID for MTS investigations.
